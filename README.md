# Reseach track: Misinformation during the Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic has been described as the first “infodemic,” where an overabundance of information makes it challenging for people to find reliable sources when they need it most. Social media in particular can create a rabbit hole effect that allows users to fall deeper and deeper into misinformation. At a time when people’s lives and our public health depend on scientific truth, it becomes more important than ever to identify and stop how societies perpetuate misinformation. In this track, you will use datasets from social media and online news to explore key drivers of misinformation during the pandemic. Ideal mentors include experts from the social sciences and clinicians in public-facing roles. Data scientists will have experience using text, network, and other social media data.

# Research question: Type of misinformation and how they spread over the internet. 

Our work focused on Twitter & News data crawled during the COVID19 pandemic, seeks to identify twitter accounts and sites publishing, myths, rumors, and misinformation related to coronavirus and also understand how myths and misinformation propagate on the internet with a larger goal to inform solutions for detecting and counteracting misinformation.

# Methodology

Approach to identify misinformation and myths associated with COVID-19:

- Catch/flag tweets similar to the top 13 COVID-19 myths debunked by NewsGuard using document similarity and identified Twitter accounts that retweet, share, and amplify these myths. 


- Identify fake news publishers based on NewsGuard fake publishers lists by matching domain names and identify the news topic using topic modeling to identify the topic and apply document similarity to link the news title to  one of the top 13 covid19 myths.
